In this chapter, you learned:

* A Camel route describes the path of a message from an origin endpoint to a destination endpoint.
* You can define routes with the Java DSL or the XML DSL.
* To use the File or FTP components to read and write files.
* For complex message routing, Camel provides built-in enterprise integration pattern (EIP) implementations.
* Routes might include message processing logic.
* You can use built-in or custom processors for message processing.
* Processors are intended for integration logic, not business logic.
