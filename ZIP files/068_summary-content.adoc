In this chapter, you learned:

* Apache Camel provides a collection of modules and JUnit extension classes known as the Camel Test Kit.
With this kit, you can implement unit and integration tests of Camel routes.

* When implementing route tests, you should replace endpoints with mocks or other test doubles to decouple tests from route dependencies.

* Apache Camel implements error handling mechanisms such as `+errorHandler+`, `+onException+`, and `+doTry/doCatch+` to capture and handle errors.
