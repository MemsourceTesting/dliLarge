=== Controlling Your Systems

[role="ilt"]
In an instructor-led training classroom, you are assigned a physical computer (`+foundation__X__.ilt.example.com+`), which is used to access the virtual machines that run on that host.
You are automatically logged in to the physical machine as the `+kiosk+` user, using `+redhat+` as the password.
The classroom systems that you work with are virtual machines running on that host.

[role="ilt"]
On `+foundation__X__+`, you use the `+rht-vmctl+` command to work with the virtual machines.
Run the commands in the following table as the `+kiosk+` user on `+foundation__X__+`.
These commands can be used with any of the virtual machines.

|Action |Command
|Start the virtual machine named `+server+`.|`+rht-vmctl start server+`
|Display the "physical console" for the virtual machine named `+server+`, to log in and work on that system |`+rht-vmview view server+`.
|Reset the virtual machine named `+server+` to its initial course state and restart it. |`+rht-vmctl reset server+`
|===

[role="ilt"]
At the start of a lab exercise, if the instruction "reset your servera" appears, then run the `+rht-vmctl reset servera+` command on the `+foundation__X__+` system as the `+kiosk+` user.
Likewise, if the instruction "reset your workstation" appears, then run the `+rht-vmctl reset workstation+` command on `+foundation__X__+` as the `+kiosk+` user.

You are assigned remote computers in a Red{nbsp}Hat Online Learning (ROLE) classroom.
Self-paced courses are accessed through a web application that is hosted at http://rol.redhat.com[rol.redhat.com].

=== Controlling the Virtual Machines

[role="role"]
The virtual machines in your classroom environment are controlled through web page interface controls.
The state of each classroom virtual machine is displayed on the btn:[Lab Environment] tab.

|Virtual Machine State |Description
|building |The virtual machine is being created.
|active |The virtual machine is running and available.
If it just started, it still might be starting services.
|stopped |The virtual machine is completely shut down.
On starting, the virtual machine boots into the same state it was in before shutdown.
The disk state is preserved.

Creates and starts all the virtual machines needed for this classroom.
Creation can take several minutes to complete.
|btn:[CREATING] |The ROLE classroom virtual machines are being created.
Creates and starts all the virtual machines that are needed for this classroom.
Creation can take several minutes to complete.
|btn:[DELETE] |Delete the ROLE classroom.
Destroys all virtual machines in the classroom.
*All saved work on those systems' disks is lost.*
|btn:[START] |Start all virtual machines in the classroom.

|Button or Action |Description
|btn:[OPEN CONSOLE] |Connect to the system console of the virtual machine in a new browser tab.
You can log in directly to the virtual machine and run commands, when required.
Normally, log in to the `+workstation+` virtual machine only, and from there, use `+ssh+` to connect to the other virtual machines.
|menu:ACTION[Start] |Start (power on) the virtual machine.
|menu:ACTION[Shutdown] |Gracefully shut down the virtual machine, preserving disk contents.
|menu:ACTION[Power Off] |Forcefully shut down the virtual machine, while still preserving disk contents.
This is equivalent to removing the power from a physical machine.
|menu:ACTION[Reset] |Forcefully shut down the virtual machine and reset associated storage to its initial state.
*All saved work on that system's disks is lost.*

[role="role"]
At the start of an exercise, if instructed to reset a single virtual machine node, click menu:ACTION[Reset]
for only that specific virtual machine.

[role="role"]
At the start of an exercise, if instructed to reset all virtual machines, click menu:ACTION[Reset]
on every virtual machine in the list.

[role="role"]
If you want to return the classroom environment to its original state at the start of the course, then click btn:[DELETE] to remove the entire classroom environment.
After the lab has been deleted, then click btn:[CREATE] to provision a new set of classroom systems.

[WARNING]
====

The btn:[DELETE] operation cannot be undone.
All completed work in the classroom environment is lost.

=== The Auto-stop and Auto-destroy Timers

[role='role']
The Red{nbsp}Hat Online Learning enrollment entitles you to a set allotment of computer time.
To help conserve your allotted time, the ROLE classroom uses timers, which shut down or delete the classroom environment when the appropriate timer expires.

// I have no idea why the btn tagging is behaving like this.
// The first one needs to be escaped; the second two must not.
// Side effect of the nbsp?
[role="role"]
To adjust the timers, locate the two btn:[\+] buttons at the bottom of the course management page.
Click the auto-stop{nbsp}btn:[+] button to add another hour to the auto-stop timer.
Click the auto-destroy{nbsp}btn:[+] button to add another day to the auto-destroy timer.
Auto-stop has a maximum of 11 hours, and auto-destroy has a maximum of 14 days.
Be careful to keep the timers set while you are working, so that your environment is not unexpectedly shut down.
Be careful not to set the timers unnecessarily high, which could waste your subscription time allotment.
