    area10: FAQ
    area100: "What are Air Passenger Rights?"
    area110: "In 2004, the European Union (EU) wrote EC Regulation 261. This is an air passenger rights law that all EU member states must abide by. It states that air passengers must be financially compensated if their flight is delayed, cancelled or overbooked. In October 2012, the EU's Court of Justice (EUCJ) made a second ruling. Passengers are entitled to compensation if their flight arrives three hours late or more, unless the delay is due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the airline's control, such as strikes or bad weather."
    area120: "Since the laws were implemented, there have been many breakthrough judgments against the airlines in the European Court of Justice. This has drastically changed the landscape for air passengers."
    area130: "What is an Assignment Form?"
    area140: "An Assignment Form is a written authorization to represent or act upon another’s behalf in a legal matter. To claim money on your behalf, AirHelp requires a signed Assignment Form from you.<br />The Assignment Form is used only for the purpose of getting your compensation from the airlines, and according to the strict code of air passenger rights. It does not authorize AirHelp to represent you in any other matter."
    area150: "How long does it take?"
    area160: "This varies by claim. Airlines typically take 4-6 weeks to respond. AirHelp consistently follows up with the airline. If your claim is rejected by the airline, AirHelp escalates the case with the local authorities, and in some cases takes the airline to court. This process can take from 6 months to a year or more."
    area170: "How do I get paid?"
    area180: "If the claim is successful, AirHelp contacts you for your preferred payment details."
    area190: "How far back can I get compensated?"
    area20: "About AirHelp"
    area200: "You can claim compensation if you have been on a delayed, canceled over overbooked flight within the last 3 years."
    area205: "automatically notifies you if your flight is eligible."
    area210: "Do I get a claim status?"
    area220: "Yes. After submitting the claim to AirHelp, you will receive email updates on every new development surrounding your claim."
    area230: "If I was not on the flight?"
    area240: "If you were not a passenger on the flight, AirHelp is not able to process your claim."
    area250: "Can I claim compensation from a flight that was paid for by someone else?"
    area260: "The compensation is for the passenger, not the person who paid for the ticket."
    area270: "I missed my connecting flight due to flight delay. Do I have a right to compensation?"
    area280: "When the same airline operates your connecting flight, you are entitled to compensation if the total delay to your final destination is more than three hours."
    area290: "What are extraordinary circumstances beyond the airlines control?"
    area30: "If you’ve been on a delayed or canceled flight within the last 3 years, you may be entitled to compensation according to EU air passenger rights. AirHelp can help you get up to €600 to compensate for the inconvenience. The compensation amounts described are estimated amounts and will change depending on the customer’s actual entitlement to compensation."
    area300: "A delayed or cancelled flight is not always the fault of the airline. Under extraordinary circumstances—such as extreme weather conditions, political unrest or strikes—airlines are not obligated to pay you compensation. If in doubt, just send us your flight ticket information and state the reason given by the airline for the delay or cancellation. AirHelp will review your claim."
    area310: "Any more questions? We’d be happy to answer them."
    area320: "Please contact us and we will get back to you as soon as possible: <a href=\"mailto:%{email}\">%{email}</a>"
    area320_expedia: "Please contact us and we will get back to you as soon as possible: <a href=\"mailto:%{email}\">%{email}</a> or %{brandPhoneNumber}"
    area40: "Getting the compensation is not easy. You have to go through time-consuming paperwork and communications with the airlines—and still there’s a strong chance that your claim will be rejected by the airline."
    area50: "%{brandDisplayName} has partnered with AirHelp to help you get your compensation easily. AirHelp checks your flight to see if you’re eligible, we prepare the required forms, we collect the evidence and legal references, and then we submit the claim to the airline on your behalf."
    area60: "Getting compensated is never easy, but we have the knowledge and expertise to make it simple."
    area70: "How do I use the service?"
    area80_90: "%{brandDisplayName} automatically sends you an email if your flight, booked via %{brandDisplayName}, may be eligible for compensation. If you want to make a compensation claim through AirHelp, the only thing you need to do is click the link to sign up for the AirHelp service and provide AirHelp with your name, email address and answer a couple of questions regarding your flight.

    airline_ceased_operations: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the airline that operated your flight has gone out of business. We took some time to contact the airline and to evaluate the situation, which is why we are just informing you now. After careful consideration, our legal team believes that the chances of recovering any compensation at all in this case are very slim and it doesn’t make sense to invest the time and expense necessary to continue. You are, of course, free to pursue your case on your own, but we unfortunately won’t be involved moving forward."
    airline_ceased_operations_details: "This means that the chances of us getting any compensation for you are really slim. It doesn’t make sense to continue when there is almost no possibility of you getting anything out of it. Of course, you’re always free to pursue your claim on your own, if you choose."
    airline_ceased_operations_title: "The airline went out of business"
    airport_problems: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that one or more airports associated with your claim were affected by extraordinary events that heavily impacted air traffic at the time of your flight disruption. Extraordinary events are incidents such as<ul><li>Emergency landings</li><li>Incidents on or damage to the tarmac</li><li>Technical glitches affecting check-in or security</li><li>Air traffic control or radar problems</li></ul>When things like this happen, it often results in air traffic congestion or even airport closure until the incident is resolved. Under the circumstances, airlines cannot be held legally accountable for delays, cancellations, and diversions, as they are unavoidable and not under the airline’s control."
    airport_problems_details: "Your flight issues were caused by airport problems, which severely messed up air traffic at one of the airports associated with your flight. These are things like:<ul><li>Emergency landings</li><li>Incidents on or damage to the tarmac</li>Air traffic control or radar problems</li></ul>These situations usually lead to a bad day for everybody, causing delays or even shutting down the airport. Because they can't be controlled or predicted, they usually fall under the category of \"extraordinary circumstances,\" which the airline isn’t liable for."
    airport_problems_title: "There were problems at the airport"
    atc_restrictions: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight in question was affected by air traffic control (ATC) restrictions. To explain further, each airport has a maximum capacity of air traffic it can handle, with flights carefully scheduled and spaced out. Unforeseen events - such as runway closure - scan reduce an airport’s capacity, delaying departures and arrivals and having a cascading effect on all subsequent traffic, even at other airports. ATC restrictions are mandatory flight schedule adjustments designed to smooth out the traffic and minimize disruptions. Since the airlines do not control these adjustments, they are not legally liable for delays or cancellations resulting from them."
    atc_restrictions_details: "From what we understand, your travel disruption or delay was caused by air traffic control (ATC) restrictions that affected traffic at one of the airports associated with your flight. As you can imagine, airports have a very strict schedule, with flights all carefully spaced out. Issues like runway closures or bad weather can have a cascading effect, disrupting subsequent flights. Air traffic controllers try to minimize the impact by holding back some flights to smooth out the traffic flow. When this happens, the airline can’t do anything about it, so they can’t be held responsible for the resulting delays or other problems."
    atc_restrictions_title: "The situation was caused by air traffic control issues"
    attack_on_the_airlines_system: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the airline or the airport were targeted by a cyber attack, or “hacked.” Airlines depend on computerized systems to check in and process passengers as well as file flight plans. Airports rely on computers for security, air traffic control, and several other critical processes. Disruptions in any one of these systems can cause significant delays. Airlines and airports employ measures to guard against hacking, but there is no way to completely ensure the security of connected computer systems. Since the nature of cyber attacks is unpredictable, airlines cannot be held responsible for flight disruptions resulting from them."
    attack_on_the_airlines_system_details: "It looks like the airline or airport was the victim of a cyber attack, which is an unpredictable event that the airline couldn’t be prepared for. Airlines work on connected computerized systems for almost all operations, so as you can imagine, hacking of or disruptions to these systems can cause all kinds of problems. These kind of attacks are obviously unpredictable, so the airline usually can’t be held responsible for them."
    attack_on_the_airlines_system_title: "Your flight disruption was due to a cyber attack"
    bad_flight_stats: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was part of a widespread series of flight delays and cancellations at one of the airports associated with your flight. While we do not have enough information to confirm the specific reason, we do know that the issue was severe enough to affect several flights and multiple carriers. Reasons could range from problems with airport facilities (emergency landings, damage to runways, technical issues with air traffic control, etc.) to security issues. The facts we do have point to an unusual issue that could not be predicted or controlled by the airline operating your flight, meaning that it would be very difficult for us to prove that they were liable for the resulting flight disruption."
    bad_flight_stats_details: "Your flight issues were caused by airport problems, which severely messed up air traffic at one of the airports associated with your flight. These are things like:<ul><li>Emergency landings</li><li>Incidents on or damage to the tarmac</li><li>Air traffic control or radar problems</li></ul>These situations usually lead to a bad day for everybody, causing delays or even shutting down the airport. Because they can't be controlled or predicted, they usually fall under the category of \"extraordinary circumstances,\" which the airline isn’t liable for."
    bad_flight_stats_title: "There were problems at the airport"
    bad_weather: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that at least one of the airports involved in your flight was affected by severe weather conditions. These may include:<ul><li>Icy conditions</li><li>Thunderstorms and heavy precipitation</li><li>Strong winds, turbulence, or up/downdrafts</li><li>Poor visibility</li><li>Volcanic activity</li></ul>Safety is of the utmost importance in air travel, so poor weather conditions can reduce or even completely halt air traffic. Weather, by its nature, cannot be controlled by the airlines. They are, therefore, not liable for delays, cancellations, or other travel disruptions resulting from severe weather."
    bad_weather_details: "Safety is always the top priority in air travel. So if the weather creates a dangerous situation at one of the airports associated with your flight, it’ll keep planes on the ground—backing up or even completely halting air traffic. These situations are considered \"extraordinary circumstances\" for which the airline isn’t liable, and may include:<ul><li>Icy conditions, thunderstorms, and heavy precipitation</li><li>Strong winds, turbulence, or up/downdrafts</li><li>Poor visibility</li><li>Volcanic ash</li></ul>"
    bad_weather_title: "Your flight was disrupted by bad weather"
    bird_strike_airline: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was caused by a bird strike, or a collision between the aircraft and a bird. These events can cause serious damage to an aircraft and pose a major safety risk. Airlines and airport authorities take steps to reduce the chances of collisions, but it is not possible to avoid or predict them in all cases. As a result, airlines cannot be held legally accountable for delays, diversions, or other travel disruptions caused by bird strikes."
    bird_strike_airline_details: "This is going to sound a little crazy... but your flight disruption was caused by a bird strike, which means a collision between the aircraft and a bird. As you can probably imagine, this can cause serious damage to an aircraft, which can lead to delays and disruptions. These kinds of things are usually considered \"extraordinary circumstances\" which the airline can’t be held responsible for."
    bird_strike_airline_title: "A bird collided with your aircraft"
    confirmed_strike: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was caused by a labor strike. The flight crew and airline employees play a key role in guaranteeing flight operations, whereas airport staff related to security, baggage handling, air traffic control, and other departments are critical in maintaining safe and efficient operations at an airport. Labor disruptions with any of these groups can significantly impact or even completely halt air traffic. In your case, the airline is not legally held accountable for delays or other flight disruptions resulting from the labor strike which occurred."
    confirmed_strike_details: "Unfortunately, your flight issues were caused by a labor strike that significantly disrupted operations at one of the airports associated with your flight. Airlines and airports need every staff member, from pilots and flight crew to baggage handlers and air traffic controllers, to do their jobs in order to run efficiently. Labor disruptions involving any of these groups are considered \"extraordinary circumstances,\" so the airline isn’t liable."
    confirmed_strike_title: "The situation was caused by an air staff strike"
    crew_illness_before_the_flight: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was caused by an unexpected illness involving one or more flight crew members of your aircraft. Flights must be staffed by the proper number of qualified and certified crew and it is not always possible for airlines to replace personnel at a moment’s notice. Replacements may have to travel a great distance to join a flight if the illness happens at an airport that is not close to the airline’s base of operations. Because they can neither predict nor control the circumstances in these cases, airlines cannot be held legally liable for resulting flight disruptions."
    crew_illness_before_the_flight_details: "It looks like your flight disruption was caused by an unexpected illness involving one or more of your airplane’s crew. Air travel regulations require a certain number of qualified crew on all flights, and it’s not always possible to bring in replacement personnel at a moment’s notice. The airline can’t always control these things, so they usually aren’t responsible for flight delays and disruptions that happen as a result."
    crew_illness_before_the_flight_title: "The situation was due to a crew member illness"
    ec261_not_applicable: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that your flight disruption falls outside the scope of European Regulation 261/2004, or EC 261. This is the law under which the majority of compensation claims are made, but it does not cover all circumstances and, unfortunately, your flight is not covered. That doesn’t mean that you can’t file your own claim for a fare reimbursement or a refund of any costs you were forced to pay due to the flight disruption, but we can’t move forward with our efforts to get you compensation from the airlines."
    ec261_not_applicable_details: "Claims like yours are normally made using EU air travel regulation EC 261. It provides compensation for many travel disruptions, but your flight isn’t covered by it. You may still be able to file a claim on your own for reimbursement or for a refund of costs you were forced to pay due to the travel disruption. But, unfortunately, that’s something we aren’t able to assist you with."
    ec261_not_applicable_title: "Air passenger regulations don’t cover your flight"
    expired_statute_of_limitations: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the statute of limitation for your right to compensation has expired. With air passenger laws, there is usually a time limit on how long your rights are valid. This limit varies from one country to the next and, if you do not take action before that time limit passes, your right to do so expires. Unfortunately, in your case, the statute of limitation has lapsed and there is nothing more we can do from a legal standpoint."
    expired_statute_of_limitations_details: "The window of opportunity to pursue your claim has closed. In other words, the \"statute of limitations\" has expired. Different countries have specific time frames in place on how long your passenger rights are valid and, since you didn’t take action before that time passed, these rights no longer apply. We’re afraid there’s nothing more we can do in this case."
    expired_statute_of_limitations_title: "Your claim has expired "
    expiring_statute_of_limitations: "Unfortunately, our flight experts have been forced to reject your claim because we're only four months away from the date of expiry. Although we constantly work on building winning strategies, in your case it will not be possible to see results any time soon."
    expiring_statute_of_limitations_details: "All compensation claims under EC 261 passenger rights regulations do eventually expire. The timeline for this is based on the limitation period in the airline's country of origin and is counted from the date of your disruption. You can still pursue your claim on your own, but keep in mind that every claim has a time limit for taking any kind of action — and the limit for yours is approaching. For more information about expiry dates for claims according to the current national law of airlines, have a look at this handy chart on our Know Your Rights pages. There you'll find all of the answers."
    expiring_statute_of_limitations_title: "We can no longer work on your claim."
    flight_diverted_bad_weather: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that your flight was diverted due to severe weather. These conditions may include:<ul><li>Icy conditions</li><li>Thunderstorms and heavy precipitation</li><li>Strong winds, turbulence, or up/downdrafts</li><li>Poor visibility</li><li>Volcanic activity</li></ul>Flight diversions are expensive decisions for an airline, but are often the most sensible course of action when weather conditions don’t allow an aircraft to safely follow its original flight plan or land at its intended destination. Weather cannot be controlled by airlines, so they are not liable for flight diversions resulting from severe weather."
    flight_diverted_bad_weather_details: "It looks like your flight was diverted because of extreme weather conditions. This may include:<ul><li>Icy conditions, thunderstorms, and heavy precipitation</li><li>Strong winds, turbulence, or up/downdrafts</li><li>Poor visibility</li><li>Volcanic ash</li></ul>Your safety is the top priority, so when conditions don’t allow the plane to safely follow its original flight plan or land at the intended destination, it is diverted. Because these situations are unavoidable, airlines are usually not legally accountable for them."
    flight_diverted_bad_weather_title: "Your flight was diverted due to bad weather"
    flight_diverted_other_reasons: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that your flight was diverted due to circumstances that the airline was not able to predict or control. These reasons may include:<ul><li>Problems at the arrival airport (such as runway closures)</li><li>Sudden illness of a passenger or crew member</li><li>Unruly passengers</li></ul>Flight diversions are often the most sensible course of action when conditions don’t allow an aircraft to safely follow its original flight plan or land at its intended destination. Since the circumstances were unforeseen and unavoidable by the airline, they can’t be legally held accountable for the resulting flight diversion."
    flight_diverted_other_reasons_details: "It looks like your flight was diverted because of unforeseen circumstances, which the airline was not able to predict or control. These are things like:<ul><li>Problems at the arrival airport (eg. runway closures)</li><li>Sudden illness of a passenger or crew member</li><li>Unruly passengers</li></ul>Obviously, your safety is the top priority, so when conditions don’t allow the plane to safely follow its original flight plan or land at the intended destination, it is diverted. Because these situations are unavoidable, airlines are usually not legally accountable for them."
    flight_diverted_other_reasons_title: "Your flight was diverted"
    lightning_strike: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was caused by lightning striking the aircraft. While most planes are designed to withstand them, it is usually necessary to thoroughly inspect the aircraft for damage after a lightning strike and, in some cases, remove it from service for repairs. Depending on the severity of the strike, flights may need to be diverted or forced to return to their departure airport. Because they are unavoidable and unpredictable, airlines cannot be held responsible for delays or cancellations due to lightning strikes."
    lightning_strike_details: "It appears your flight was disrupted because the aircraft was struck by lightning. Lightning strikes aren’t as rare as you may think, and planes are designed to withstand them. Nevertheless, a thorough inspection of the aircraft is usually necessary afterwards. In some cases, the aircraft must be taken out of service for repairs. If the flight is struck in the air, it could even force a flight diversion. These kinds of weather-related events are usually considered \"extraordinary circumstances\" which the airline can’t be held responsible for."
    lightning_strike_title: "Your plane was struck by lightning"
    no_evidence_of_the_disruption: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that we have no evidence that the flight disruption occurred. Normally, flight records from the airline or independent flight status reports are used to provide documentation that the flight was either delayed, canceled, or that the passenger was denied boarding of the flight. In this case, we have no official record of the incident at all, which means we would be unable to prove our case in court."
    no_evidence_of_the_disruption_details: "In order to proceed with your claim, we would have to be able to show that something went wrong — a delay, cancellation, or some other covered travel issue — but we have no proof of that in this case. Airlines keep very detailed records of these things and, in this instance, there is no indication of any problems. Unfortunately, without some kind of evidence, there is not much we can do."
    no_evidence_of_the_disruption_title: "There is no evidence of a flight disruption"
    other: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was due to circumstances that could not be controlled or predicted by the airline. After reviewing the situation we have determined that, even if the airline had attempted to take reasonable measures to avoid the disruption, like replacing the aircraft or crew or by substituting another comparable flight, it was not possible. Since the situation was not caused by the airline and there was no way for them to avoid it, they can’t be held legally responsible for resulting flight delays and cancellations."
    other_details: "Your travel disruption was caused by a situation that couldn’t be controlled or predicted by the airline. After taking a closer look, it’s clear that it wasn’t possible for the airline to take reasonable measures to avoid the problem. We’re afraid it’s just one of those things. Since the situation was not caused by the airline and there was no way for them to avoid it, they can’t be held responsible for the resulting flight problems."
    other_title: "The airline couldn’t have done anything to avoid the issue"
    political_instability: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was caused by political instability or war in the region where your flight was scheduled to occur. Since safe operations in these conditions are impossible to guarantee, cancellations or even the total suspension of all service is normally the only sensible course of action. Since airlines have no control over the situation, they cannot be held accountable for resulting flight disruptions."
    political_instability_details: "It looks like your flight was disrupted because of political instability or war in the region where you intended to fly. This is an unpredictable and unavoidable situation, also called a \"force majeure,\" if you want to get technical. Your safety is the top priority at all times during air travel. And since the airline can’t control these things, they aren’t responsible for flight delays and disruptions that happen as a result."
    political_instability_title: "The situation was caused by political instability"
    previous_flight_bad_weather: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was due to severe weather affecting a previous flight. These conditions may include:<ul><li>Icy conditions</li><li>Thunderstorms and heavy precipitation</li><li>Strong winds, turbulence, or up/downdrafts</li><li>Poor visibility</li><li>Volcanic activity</li></ul>In the majority of cases, aircraft are used multiple times per day. Any disruption in one flight could have a cascading effect on subsequent flights scheduled for that aircraft. Weather cannot be controlled by airlines, so they are not liable for flight disruptions resulting from severe weather, including in cases where a delay or cancellation affects subsequent flights."
    previous_flight_bad_weather_details: "It looks like your travel problems were due to bad weather affecting a previous flight. These situations may include:<ul><li>Icy conditions, thunderstorms, and heavy precipitation</li><li>Strong winds, turbulence, or up/downdrafts</li><li>Poor visibility</li><li>Volcanic ash</li></ul>Aircraft are often used multiple times per day and a disruption to one flight could have a snowball effect on later flights, like yours, scheduled for that particular plane. Safety is always the top priority in air travel, so if the weather creates a dangerous situation, it’ll keep planes on the ground—backing up or even completely halting air traffic. These kinds of things are usually considered \"extraordinary circumstances\" which the airline can’t be held responsible for."
    previous_flight_bad_weather_title: "The situation was due to issues with a previous flight"
    previous_flight_other_reasons: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was due to issues with a previous flight resulting from circumstances that the airline was not able to predict or control. These reasons may include:<ul><li>Problems at the departure airport (such as runway closures)</li><li>Bird strikes (collision between the aircraft and a bird)</li><li>Lightning striking the aircraft</li><li>Sudden illness of a passenger or crew member</li><li>Unruly passengers</li></ul>In the majority of cases, aircraft are used multiple times per day. Any disruption in one flight could have a cascading effect on subsequent flights scheduled for that aircraft. Since the circumstances were unforeseen and unavoidable by the airline, they can’t be legally held accountable for the resulting flight disruption, including in cases where a delay or cancellation affects subsequent flights."

Since the circumstances were unforeseen and unavoidable by the airline, they can’t be legally held accountable for the resulting flight disruption, including in cases where a delay or cancellation affects subsequent flights."
    security_issues: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was due to security issues, which may include the following:<ul><li>Evacuation of flights while at the terminal</li><li>Reports or threats of violence at the airport</li><li>Terrorist attacks or coup attempts</li><li>Unruly or suspicious passengers</li><li>Protesters or unauthorized people in secure areas</li></ul>These situations cannot be predicted or controlled by the airline, so it is not possible to hold them legally accountable for resulting flight disruptions."
    security_issues_details: "It looks like your flight was disrupted because of unexpected security issues at one of the airports associated with your flight. These are things like:<ul><li>Evacuation of flights while at the terminal</li><li>Reports of violence or coup attempts</li><li>Suspicious or unruly passengers.</li></ul>These types of things usually lead to a bad day for everybody, causing delays or even shutting down the airport. Since your safety is the top priority in air travel, and these \"extraordinary circumstances\" can’t be controlled or predicted, then the airline can’t be held responsible for them."
    security_issues_title: "The situation was caused by security concerns"
    sickness_during_flight: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was due to an illness affecting one or more passengers or members of the airplane’s crew during the flight. In these cases, flights may be diverted to quickly secure medical care for the affected individuals. Likewise, if the illness involves the crew, it may be necessary to divert the flight, since airplanes cannot be safely operated without a full staff. Because they can neither predict nor control the circumstances in these cases, airlines cannot be held legally liable for resulting flight disruptions."
    sickness_during_flight_details: "It looks like your flight disruption was due to an illness affecting one or more passengers or members of the airplane’s crew. Safety is the top priority in air travel, so when a situation like this occurs in the air, flights can be diverted to ensure medical treatment for those affected. Since the airline can’t control or plan for these sorts of things, they aren’t responsible for flight delays and disruptions that happen as a result."

    weak_jurisdiction: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the flight disruption was due to circumstances that could not be controlled or predicted by the airline. After reviewing the situation we have determined that, even if the airline had attempted to take reasonable measures to avoid the disruption, like replacing the aircraft or crew or by substituting another comparable flight, it was not possible. Since the situation was not caused by the airline and there was no way for them to avoid it, they can’t be held legally responsible for resulting flight delays and cancellations."
    weak_jurisdiction_details: "When it comes to air passenger rights, even though the regulations are clear, some places are more difficult than others when it comes to applying them.

We took some time to contact the airline and to evaluate the situation, which is why we are just informing you now. After careful consideration, our legal team believes that the chances of recovering any compensation at all in this case are very slim and it doesn’t make sense to invest the time and expense necessary to continue. You are, of course, free to pursue your case on your own, but we unfortunately won’t be involved moving forward."

    airline_ineligible: "Your claim is not covered by European regulation EC 261. This law states that flights from outside the EU must be operated by an EU carrier to be eligible for compensation. It is important to note that in cases where multiple legs of a trip are operated by the same airline, it’s the first leg with that carrier that determines eligibility, regardless of which one was disrupted."
    airline_ineligible_details: "Claims like yours are made under a European regulation called EC 261. In order to be eligible, it says flights from outside the EU need to be operated by EU carriers.

Sometimes this is covered, like when you’re bumped from an overbooked flight, but this situation appears to be different. Other reasons that could potentially lead to being denied boarding are things like not having the necessary ID or boarding documents to get on the flight, or security concerns that prevented you from boarding.

    informed_beforehand: "The airline provided notice of the flight cancellation at least 14 days prior to the scheduled departure. According to the law, if they meet this obligation, they are not held liable for resulting travel disruptions, since this should provide adequate time for customers to reschedule. The airline must notify passengers directly and not rely on communication via third parties, such as an online travel agency, who may have booked the flight on behalf of the traveler."
    informed_beforehand_details: "Claims like yours are made under a law called EC 261, which normally provides compensation for canceled flights. But it also says that airlines don’t have to pay you if they provide you with at least 14 days notice of the cancellation, which they seem to have done.

Because they can neither predict nor control the circumstances in these cases, airlines cannot be held responsible for resulting flight disruptions."
    medical_grounds_details: "It looks like your flight disruption was due to an illness affecting one or more passengers or members of the airplane’s crew. Safety is the top priority in air travel, so when a situation like this occurs in the air, flights can be diverted to ensure medical treatment for those affected.

    political_instability: "According to the information we have, your flight disruption was caused by political instability or war in the region where your flight was scheduled to occur. Since safe operations in these conditions are impossible to guarantee, cancellations or even the total suspension of all service is normally the only sensible course of action. These situations often cannot be predicted or controlled by the airline, so they usually fall under the category of extraordinary circumstances for which the airline is not liable."

Under EU law, if you accept re-routing on an alternative flight and arrive at your destination within a given timeframe, depending on your flight details, it can affect your eligibility and the compensation amount you are owed. In this case, the airline met its legal obligation and cannot be held liable."
    rerouting_acceptable_details: "Claims like yours are made under an EU regulation called EC 261, which normally provides compensation for flight delays, cancellations, or other travel disruptions. However, if you accepted an alternative flight and it arrived at your destination within a given time frame, then it’s not eligible for compensation.

    rerouting_acceptable_title: "Your rerouted flight still arrived in good time"
    strike: "According to the information we have, your flight disruption was caused by a labor strike. The flight crew and airline employees play a key role in guaranteeing flight operations, whereas airport staff related to security, baggage handling, air traffic control, and other departments are critical in maintaining safe and efficient operations at an airport. Labor disruptions with any of these groups can significantly impact or even completely halt air traffic. These situations usually fall under the category of extraordinary circumstances for which the airline is not liable."
    strike_details: "Unfortunately, your flight issues were caused by a labor strike that significantly disrupted operations at one of the airports associated with your flight. Airlines and airports need every staff member, from pilots and flight crew to baggage handlers and air traffic controllers, to do their jobs in order to run efficiently. Labor disruptions involving any of these groups are considered \"extraordinary circumstances,\" so the airline isn’t liable."
    strike_title: "The situation was caused by an air staff strike"
    ticket_free_of_charge: "According to the information we have, your compensation claim is in regards to a flight that you did not pay full price for. Free or discounted tickets are not eligible for compensation under European regulation EC 261. The airline, therefore, cannot be held liable for any travel disruptions that you may have experienced on this particular flight."
    ticket_free_of_charge_details: "From what we understand, your claim is for a flight for which you initially paid a reduced fare or even received free of charge. Claims like yours are made under an EU regulation called EC 261, which normally provides compensation for flight disruptions. However, free or discounted tickets do not qualify for compensation."

    air_traffic_control_restrictions: "The airline has stated that the flight disruption was caused by air traffic control (ATC) restrictions. To explain further, each airport has a maximum capacity of air traffic it can handle, with flights carefully scheduled and spaced out. Unforeseen events - such as runway closures or bad weather - can reduce an airport’s capacity, delaying departures and arrivals and having a cascading effect on all subsequent traffic, even at other airports. ATC restrictions are mandatory flight schedule adjustments designed to smooth out the traffic and minimize disruptions. While airlines may not be held liable for flight disruptions due to these situations, it does depend on the circumstances in each instance."
    air_traffic_control_restrictions_details: "From what we understand, your travel disruption or delay was caused by air traffic control (ATC) restrictions that affected traffic at one of the airports associated with your flight. As you can imagine, airports have a very strict schedule, with flights all carefully spaced out. Issues like runway closures or bad weather can have a cascading effect, disrupting subsequent flights. Air traffic controllers try to minimize the impact by holding back some flights to smooth out the traffic flow. When this happens, the airline can’t do anything about it, so they can’t be held responsible for the resulting delays or other problems."

You are, of course, free to pursue your case on your own, but we unfortunately won’t be involved moving forward."

    attack_on_the_airlines_system: "The reason we cannot continue with your claim is that the airline or the airport were targeted by a cyber attack, or “hacked.” Airlines depend on computerized systems to check in and process passengers as well as file flight plans. Airports rely on computers for security, air traffic control, and several other critical processes. Disruptions in any one of these systems can cause significant delays. Airlines and airports employ measures to guard against hacking, but there is no way to completely ensure the security of connected computer systems. Since the nature of cyber attacks is unpredictable, airlines cannot be held responsible for flight disruptions resulting from them."
    attack_on_the_airlines_system_details: "It looks like the airline or airport was the victim of a cyber attack, which is an unpredictable event that the airline couldn’t be prepared for. Airlines work on connected computerized systems for almost all operations, so as you can imagine, hacking of or disruptions to these systems can cause all kinds of problems. These kind of attacks are obviously unpredictable, so the airline usually can’t be held responsible for them."

    bird_strike: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by a bird strike, or a collision between the aircraft and a bird. These events can cause serious damage to an aircraft and pose a major safety risk. There may be situations in which the airline is not legally liable for resulting flight disruptions, but further investigation is needed to determine what amount of responsibility the airline should bear in this case. At this point we see no reason why the airline should not be held accountable."
    bird_strike_details: "This is going to sound a little crazy... but your flight disruption was caused by a bird strike, which means a collision between the aircraft and a bird. As you can probably imagine, this can cause serious damage to an aircraft, which can lead to delays and disruptions.

With air passenger laws, there is usually a time limit on how long your rights are valid. If you do not take action before that time limit passes, you lose the right to do so. The statute of limitation varies from one country to the next, so further investigation is needed to determine which one applies in your case."

While there may be some circumstances in which an airline is not held liable for flight disruptions due to staffing issues, they are normally expected to account for problems as they arise with extra personnel. Further investigation is needed to determine what amount of responsibility the airline should bear in this case, but at this point we see no reason why the airline should not be held accountable."
    crew_problems_details: "It looks like your flight disruption was caused by an unexpected illness involving one or more of your airplane’s crew. Air travel regulations require a certain number of qualified crew on all flights, and it’s not always possible to bring in replacement personnel at a moment’s notice. The airline can’t always control these things, so they usually aren’t responsible for flight delays and disruptions that happen as a result."
    crew_problems_title: "The situation was due to a crew member illness"
    denied_boarding_at_checkin_gate: "The airline has stated that your travel disruption was due to the fact that you were denied boarding at check-in. This could be due to several reasons, including inadequate identification or boarding documents, security concerns over allowing you to board, or simply not having enough room on the flight due to overbooking. The airline’s liability in this matter depends greatly on the circumstances involved and the reasoning behind their actions."

    extraordinary_circumstances_title: "The situation was caused by a major event"
    final_delay_less_than_3_hours: "The airline has stated that your flight delay was not long enough to qualify for compensation. Under EU law, flight delays are eligible only if the total delay at your final destination exceeds 3 hours. This time is measured from gate to gate, when the aircraft is parked at the terminal and the door is opened."
    final_delay_less_than_3_hours_details: "It looks like your flight delay wasn’t long enough to qualify for compensation. Claims like yours are made under an EU regulation called EC 261, which normally provides compensation for canceled or delayed flights. But it also says that airlines don’t have to pay you if the total delay at your final destination was less than 3 hours, no matter how late the flight actually took off from the departure airport. They measure this from gate to gate, ending when the plane is parked and the door is opened."
    final_delay_less_than_3_hours_title: "Your delay at your final destination was less than 3 hours"
    flight_diverted: "The airline has stated that your flight was diverted due to circumstances that they were not able to predict or control. These reasons may include:<ul><li>Problems at the arrival airport (such as runway closures)</li><li>Sudden illness of a passenger or crew member</li><li>Unruly passengers</li></ul>Flight diversions are often the most sensible course of action when conditions don’t allow an aircraft to safely follow its original flight plan or land at its intended destination. Since the circumstances were unforeseen and unavoidable by the airline, they can’t be legally held accountable for the resulting flight diversion."
    flight_diverted_details: "It looks like your flight was diverted because of unforeseen circumstances, which the airline was not able to predict or control. These are things like:<ul><li>Problems at the arrival airport (eg. runway closures)</li><li>Sudden illness of a passenger or crew member</li><li>Unruly passengers</li></ul>Obviously, your safety is the top priority, so when conditions don’t allow the plane to safely follow its original flight plan or land at the intended destination, it is diverted. Because these situations are unavoidable, airlines are usually not legally accountable for them."
    flight_diverted_title: "Your flight was diverted"
    force_majeure: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by an unpredictable and unavoidable situation, also called “force majeure” in legal terms. Some examples of this type of occurrence are:<ul><li>Floods</li><li>Tornadoes</li><li>Earthquakes/tsunamis</li><li>War or political upheaval</li><li>Volcanic activity</li></ul>This is an incident that is outside the control of the airline and is something they could not be reasonably expected to account for. As such, they are not legally held liable for the situation or any flight disruptions occurring as a result."
    force_majeure_details: "This is an unpredictable and unavoidable situation, also called a \"force majeure,\" if you want to get technical. Some examples of this are floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, volcanic eruptions, etc. Since these situations are obviously outside of the airline’s control, they aren’t responsible for flight disruptions that happen as a result."
    force_majeure_title: "The situation was caused by a major event"
    ignored_by_airline: "The airline has not responded to our multiple attempts to contact them. This obviously does not absolve them of their obligations under the law, and we will exercise any options at our disposal to compel them to meet those obligations."
    ignored_by_airline_details: "The airline has not responded to our multiple attempts to contact them. This obviously does not absolve them of their obligations under the law, and we will exercise any options at our disposal to compel them to meet those obligations."
    industrial_related_issues: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by a labor strike. These situations can significantly impact or even completely halt air traffic and are sometimes cited as “extreme circumstances” that would absolve the airline of any liability for flight disruptions. However, if the airline is a party in negotiations with the workers on strike, it cannot be assumed that they have no control over the situation. Further investigation is needed to determine how much responsibility the airline should be assigned for the strike."

However, if the airline is a party in negotiations with the workers on strike, it cannot be assumed that they have no control over the situation. Further investigation is needed to determine how much responsibility the airline should be assigned for the strike."
    insufficient_compensation_offered_by_airline: "The airline has offered a compensation amount that is less than what you are legally entitled to. Our goal is to make sure that our clients are treated fairly and that the airlines obey the law, but they have so far rejected our requests that they meet their financial obligation in full."

Our goal is to make sure that our clients are treated fairly and that the airlines obey the law, but they have so far rejected our requests that they meet their financial obligation in full."
    lightning_strike: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by lightning striking the aircraft. While most planes are designed to withstand them, it is usually necessary to thoroughly inspect the aircraft for damage after a lightning strike and, in some cases, remove it from service for repairs. Depending on the severity of the strike, flights may need to be diverted or forced to return to their departure airport. There may be situations in which the airline is not legally liable for resulting flight disruptions, but further investigation is needed to determine what amount of responsibility the airline should bear in this case. At this point we see no reason why the airline should not be held accountable."
    lightning_strike_details: "It appears your flight was disrupted because the aircraft was struck by lightning. Lightning strikes aren’t as rare as you may think, and planes are designed to withstand them. Nevertheless, a thorough inspection of the aircraft is usually necessary afterwards. In some cases, the aircraft must be taken out of service for repairs. If the flight is struck in the air, it could even force a flight diversion. These kinds of weather-related events are usually considered \"extraordinary circumstances\" which the airline can’t be held responsible for."
    lightning_strike_title: "Your plane was struck by lightning"
    medical_grounds: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was due to an illness affecting one or more passengers or members of the airplane’s crew. In cases where the situation occurs in the air, flights may be diverted to quickly secure medical care for the affected individuals. Because they can neither predict nor control the circumstances in these cases, airlines are not usually held responsible for resulting flight disruptions. On the other hand, the airline may be liable if the situation involves a crew member, occurs before departure, and can reasonably be addressed by the airline."
    medical_grounds_details: "It looks like your flight disruption was due to an illness affecting one or more passengers or members of the airplane’s crew. Safety is the top priority in air travel, so when a situation like this occurs in the air, flights can be diverted to ensure medical treatment for those affected. Since the airline can’t control or plan for these sorts of things, they aren’t responsible for flight delays and disruptions that happen as a result."
    medical_grounds_title: "Your travel disruption was due to a medical emergency"
    no_reason_stated: "The airline has not provided a reason for their rejection of your claim and has not yet complied with our requests for clarification. This is obviously unacceptable. Unless they can provide adequate justification or reasoning for their stance, we believe that they should be held to their obligation to compensate you, as required by law."

Unless they can provide adequate justification or reasoning for their stance, we believe that they should be held to their obligation to compensate you, as required by law."
    non_eu_carrier_departed_from_non_eu_airport: "The airline has stated that your claim is not covered by European passenger protection law, as it does not meet the criteria specified under regulation EC 261. This law states that flights from outside the EU must be operated by an EU carrier to be eligible for compensation. It is important to note that in cases where multiple legs of a trip are operated by the same airline, it’s the first leg with that carrier that determines eligibility, regardless of which one was disrupted."
    non_eu_carrier_departed_from_non_eu_airport_details: "Claims like yours are made under a European regulation called EC 261. In order to be eligible, it says flights from outside the EU need to be operated by EU carriers. One thing to keep in mind is that, if multiple legs of a trip are with the same airline, it’s the first leg with that carrier that determines eligibility, no matter which one was actually disrupted."
    non_eu_carrier_departed_from_non_eu_airport_title: "Your flight wasn’t with an EU airline"
    not_applicable_under_the_regulation: "According to the airline, the claim is not applicable under Regulation (EC) 261/2004"
    operational_circumstances: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was due to “operational circumstances.” Getting a flight ready to go and off the ground depends on a lot of systems working in concert. Any breakdowns in one system can have a cascading effect down the line, leading to delayed flights or worse. While keeping everything running smoothly is no small task, it is still the airline’s responsibility to do so, and we do not think that problems resulting from failures in these operations should qualify as “extraordinary circumstances.”"

    political_instability: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by political instability or war in the region where your flight was scheduled to occur. Since safe operations in these conditions are impossible to guarantee, cancellations or even the total suspension of all service is normally the only sensible course of action. These situations often cannot be predicted or controlled by the airline, so it is not always possible to hold them legally accountable for resulting flight disruptions, although it does depend on the particular circumstances involved."
    political_instability_details: "It looks like your flight was disrupted because of political instability or war in the region where you intended to fly. This is an unpredictable and unavoidable situation, also called a \"force majeure,\" if you want to get technical. Your safety is the top priority at all times during air travel. And since the airline can’t control these things, they aren’t responsible for flight delays and disruptions that happen as a result."
    political_instability_title: "The situation was caused by political instability"
    previous_flight: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was due to issues with a previous flight. These may include:<ul><li>Problems at the departure airport (such as runway closures)</li><li>Bird strikes (collision between the aircraft and a bird)</li><li>Lightning striking the aircraft</li><li>Sudden illness of a passenger or crew member</li><li>Unruly passengers</li></ul>In the majority of cases, aircraft are used multiple times per day and any disruption in one flight could have a cascading effect on subsequent flights scheduled for that aircraft. There may be situations in which the airline is not legally liable for these flight disruptions, but further investigation is needed to determine what amount of responsibility the airline should bear in this case. At this point we see no reason why the airline should not be held accountable."
    previous_flight_details: "It looks like your flight disruption was due to issues with a previous flight. These are things like:<ul><li>Airport problems affecting a previous flight (such as runway closures)</li><li>Bird strikes (collision between the aircraft and a bird)</li><li>Lightning striking the aircraft</li><li>Sudden illness of a passenger or crew member</li><li>Unruly passengers</li></ul>Most of the time, aircraft are used multiple times per day and a disruption to one flight could have a snowball effect on later flights, like yours, scheduled for that particular plane. These kinds of things are usually considered \"extraordinary circumstances\" which the airline can’t be held responsible for."
    previous_flight_title: "The situation was due to issues with a previous flight"
    problems_at_the_airport: "The airline has stated that the flight disruption was caused by extraordinary events affecting one or more airports associated with your claim, which heavily impacted air traffic at the time of your flight disruption. Extraordinary events are incidents such as:<ul><li>Emergency landings</li><li>Incidents on or damage to the tarmac</li><li>Technical glitches affecting check-in or security</li><li>Air traffic control or radar problems</li></ul>When things like this happen, it often results in air traffic congestion or even airport closure until the incident is resolved. While airlines may not be held liable for flight disruptions due to these situations, it does depend on the circumstances in each instance."
    problems_at_the_airport_details: "Your flight issues were caused by airport problems, which severely messed up air traffic at one of the airports associated with your flight. These are things like:<ul><li>Emergency landings</li><li>Incidents on or damage to the tarmac</li>Air traffic control or radar problems</li></ul>These situations usually lead to a bad day for everybody, causing delays or even shutting down the airport. Because they can't be controlled or predicted, they usually fall under the category of \"extraordinary circumstances,\" which the airline isn’t liable for."
    problems_at_the_airport_title: "There were problems at the airport"
    rerouting_within_acceptable_time_frame: "The airline claims that you arrived at your final destination within a legally acceptable timeframe. Under EU law, if you accept re-routing on an alternative flight and arrive at your destination within a given timeframe, depending on your flight details, it can affect your eligibility and the compensation amount you are owed."
    rerouting_within_acceptable_time_frame_details: "Claims like yours are made under an EU regulation called EC 261, which normally provides compensation for flight delays, cancellations, or other travel disruptions. However, if you accepted an alternative flight and it arrived at your destination within a given time frame, then it’s not eligible for compensation. Since the airline got you to your destination in relatively good time, they can’t be held liable, according to the regulation."
    rerouting_within_acceptable_time_frame_title: "Your rerouted flight still arrived in good time"
    security_reasons: "The airline has stated that the flight disruption was due to security issues, which may include the following:<ul><li>Evacuation of flights while at the terminal</li><li>Reports or threats of violence at the airport</li><li>Terrorist attacks or coup attempts</li><li>Unruly or suspicious passengers.</li><li>Protesters or unauthorized people in secure areas</li></ul>While airlines might not be held liable for flight disruptions due to these situations, it does depend on the circumstances in each instance."
    security_reasons_details: "It looks like your flight was disrupted because of unexpected security issues at one of the airports associated with your flight. These are things like:<ul><li>Evacuation of flights while at the terminal</li><li>Reports of violence or coup attempts</li><li>Suspicious or unruly passengers.</li></ul>These types of things usually lead to a bad day for everybody, causing delays or even shutting down the airport. Since your safety is the top priority in air travel, and these \"extraordinary circumstances\" can’t be controlled or predicted, then the airline can’t be held responsible for them."
    security_reasons_title: "The situation was caused by security concerns"
    strike: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by a labor strike. The flight crew and airline employees play a key role in guaranteeing flight operations, whereas airport staff related to security, baggage handling, air traffic control, and other departments are critical in maintaining safe and efficient operations at an airport. Labor disruptions with any of these groups can significantly impact or even completely halt air traffic. These situations often cannot be predicted or controlled by the airline, so it is not always possible to hold them legally accountable for resulting flight disruptions, although it does depend on the particular circumstances involved."
    strike_details: "Unfortunately, your flight issues were caused by a labor strike that significantly disrupted operations at one of the airports associated with your flight. Airlines and airports need every staff member, from pilots and flight crew to baggage handlers and air traffic controllers, to do their jobs in order to run efficiently. Labor disruptions involving any of these groups are considered \"extraordinary circumstances,\" so the airline isn’t liable."
    strike_title: "The situation was caused by an air staff strike"
    technical_problems: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was due to an unforeseen technical problem with the aircraft. While there are some instances in which airlines cannot be held accountable, such as parts manufacturer defects, there are many other situations where the airline may, indeed, be required to pay compensation. Further investigation is needed to determine the circumstances in your case."

    weather_conditions: "The airline has stated that the flight disruption was caused by severe weather conditions. These may include:<ul><li>Icy conditions</li><li>Thunderstorms and heavy precipitation</li><li>Strong winds, turbulence, or up/downdrafts</li><li>Poor visibility</li><li>Volcanic activity</li></ul>Safety is of the utmost importance in air travel, so poor weather conditions can reduce or even completely halt air traffic. While airlines may not be held liable for flight disruptions due to severe weather, further investigation is needed to confirm the circumstances in your case."
    weather_conditions_details: "Safety is always the top priority in air travel. So if the weather creates a dangerous situation at one of the airports associated with your flight, it’ll keep planes on the ground—backing up or even completely halting air traffic.

  wrongfully_rejected_by_airline: "Rejected by airline<br>Awaiting legal assessment"
  wrongfully_rejected_by_airline_reason:
    air_traffic_control_restrictions: "The airline has stated that the flight disruption was caused by air traffic control (ATC) restrictions. To explain further, each airport has a maximum capacity of air traffic it can handle, with flights carefully scheduled and spaced out. Unforeseen events- such as runway closures or bad weather- can reduce an airport’s capacity, delaying departures and arrivals and having a cascading effect on all subsequent traffic, even at other airports. ATC restrictions are mandatory flight schedule adjustments designed to smooth out the traffic and minimize disruptions. While airlines may not be held liable for flight disruptions due to these situations, it does depend on the circumstances in each instance."
    airline_is_responsive_but_no_reason_received: "The airline has not provided a reason for their rejection of your claim and has not yet complied with our requests for clarification. This is obviously unacceptable. Unless they can provide adequate justification or reasoning for their stance, we believe that they should be held to their obligation to compensate you, as required by law."
    airline_requested_documents_inconsistent_with_airhelp_policy: "The airline has demanded documents or paperwork that is not necessary to process your claim and refuses to proceed without it. Our goal is to make the claim process as easy and painless as possible for you, so when the airlines make unreasonable demands that cause delays and complications, it’s our job to stand firm. We are very familiar with the claims process and know which documents are legally required and which are not, so we are confident that we are in the right."
    bird_strike: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by a bird strike, or a collision between the aircraft and a bird. These events can cause serious damage to an aircraft and pose a major safety risk. There may be situations in which the airline is not legally liable for resulting flight disruptions, but further investigation is needed to determine what amount of responsibility the airline should bear in this case. At this point we see no reason why the airline should not be held accountable."
    cancellation_14_days_upfront: "The airline claims that it provided notice of the flight cancellation at least 14 days prior to the scheduled departure. According to the law, if they meet this obligation, they are not held liable for resulting travel disruptions, since this should provide adequate time for customers to reschedule. The airline must notify passengers directly and not rely on communication via third parties, such as an online travel agency, who may have booked the flight on behalf of the traveler."
    claim_expired: "The airline has stated that the statute of limitation for your right to compensation has expired. With air passenger laws, there is usually a time limit on how long your rights are valid. If you do not take action before that time limit passes, you lose the right to do so. The statute of limitation varies from one country to the next, so further investigation is needed to determine which one applies in your case."
    client_didnt_present_for_checkin_gate: "The airline claims that you were not present for check-in at the departure time for your flight. Passengers must be aware of their flight schedules and boarding procedures and must be attentive to ground crew announcements concerning their flights. If passengers fail to show up in a timely manner at the correct departure gate, airlines cannot be held responsible for missed flights and resulting travel delays."
    compensation_sent_directly_to_client: "The airline refuses to pay your compensation to us, even though we are authorized to receive it on your behalf. The Assignment Form that allows us to represent you as a client effectively transfers legal ownership of your claim to AirHelp. Despite the fact that we provided the airline with a copy of the Assignment Form, they have so far refused to honor the document or comply with our requests for payment."
    crew_problems: "The airline has stated that your travel disruption was due to staffing issues with the flight crew. While there may be some circumstances in which an airline is not held liable for flight disruptions due to staffing issues, they are normally expected to account for problems as they arise with extra personnel. Further investigation is needed to determine what amount of responsibility the airline should bear in this case, but at this point we see no reason why the airline should not be held accountable."
    denied_boarding_at_checkin_gate: "The airline has stated that your travel disruption was due to the fact that you were denied boarding at check-in. This could be due to several reasons, including inadequate identification or boarding documents, security concerns over allowing you to board, or simply not having enough room on the flight due to overbooking. The airline’s liability in this matter depends greatly on the circumstances involved and the reasoning behind their actions."
    disinfection_of_the_aircraft: "The airline has stated that your travel disruption was due to a situation that required the total disinfection of the aircraft. Whether or not the airline can be held legally liable for the issue is not clear without more information. Much of it depends on the circumstances of the case, such as the reason disinfection was required and whether or not any reasonable effort could have been made to prevent or mitigate the disruption."
    final_delay_less_than_3_hours: "The airline has stated that your flight delay was not long enough to qualify for compensation. Under EU law, flight delays are eligible only if the total delay at your final destination exceeds 3 hours. This time is measured from gate to gate, when the aircraft is parked at the terminal and the door is opened."
    ignored_by_airline: "The airline has not responded to our multiple attempts to contact them. This obviously does not absolve them of their obligations under the law, and we will exercise any options at our disposal to compel them to meet those obligations."
    industrial_related_issues: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by a labor strike. These situations can significantly impact or even completely halt air traffic and are sometimes cited as “extreme circumstances” that would absolve the airline of any liability for flight disruptions. However, if the airline is a party in negotiations with the workers on strike, it cannot be assumed that they have no control over the situation. Further investigation is needed to determine how much responsibility the airline should be assigned for the strike."
    insufficient_compensation_offered_by_airline: "The airline has offered a compensation amount that is less than what you are legally entitled to. Our goal is to make sure that our clients are treated fairly and that the airlines obey the law, but they have so far rejected our requests that they meet their financial obligation in full."
    lightning_strike: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by lightning striking the aircraft. While most planes are designed to withstand them, it is usually necessary to thoroughly inspect the aircraft for damage after a lightning strike and, in some cases, remove it from service for repairs. Depending on the severity of the strike, flights may need to be diverted or forced to return to their departure airport. There may be situations in which the airline is not legally liable for resulting flight disruptions, but further investigation is needed to determine what amount of responsibility the airline should bear in this case. At this point we see no reason why the airline should not be held accountable."
    medical_grounds: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was due to an illness affecting one or more passengers or members of the airplane’s crew. In cases where the situation occurs in the air, flights may be diverted to quickly secure medical care for the affected individuals. Because they can neither predict nor control the circumstances in these cases, airlines are not usually held responsible for resulting flight disruptions. On the other hand, the airline may be liable if the situation involves a crew member, occurs before departure, and can reasonably be addressed by the airline."
    no_reason_stated: "The airline did not provide a reason for the rejection of your claim."
    non_eu_carrier_departed_from_non_eu_airport: "The airline has stated that your claim is not covered by European passenger protection law, as it does not meet the criteria specified under regulation EC 261. This law states that flights from outside the EU must be operated by an EU carrier to be eligible for compensation. It is important to note that in cases where multiple legs of a trip are operated by the same airline, it’s the first leg with that carrier that determines eligibility, regardless of which one was disrupted."
    operational_circumstances: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was due to “operational circumstances.” Getting a flight ready to go and off the ground depends on a lot of systems working in concert. Any breakdowns in one system can have a cascading effect down the line, leading to delayed flights or worse. While keeping everything running smoothly is no small task, it is still the airline’s responsibility to do so, and we do not think that problems resulting from failures in these operations should qualify as “extraordinary circumstances.”"
    political_instability: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by political instability or war in the region where your flight was scheduled to occur. Since safe operations in these conditions are impossible to guarantee, cancellations or even the total suspension of all service is normally the only sensible course of action. These situations often cannot be predicted or controlled by the airline, so it is not always possible to hold them legally accountable for resulting flight disruptions, although it does depend on the particular circumstances involved."
    previous_flight: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was due to issues with a previous flight. These may include:<ul><li>Problems at the departure airport (such as runway closures)</li><li>Bird strikes (collision between the aircraft and a bird)</li><li>Lightning striking the aircraft</li><li>Sudden illness of a passenger or crew member</li><li>Unruly passengers</li></ul>In the majority of cases, aircraft are used multiple times per day and any disruption in one flight could have a cascading effect on subsequent flights scheduled for that aircraft. There may be situations in which the airline is not legally liable for these flight disruptions, but further investigation is needed to determine what amount of responsibility the airline should bear in this case. At this point we see no reason why the airline should not be held accountable."
    problems_at_the_airport: "The airline has stated that the flight disruption was caused by extraordinary events affecting one or more airports associated with your claim, which heavily impacted air traffic at the time of your flight disruption. Extraordinary events are incidents such as:<ul><li>Emergency landings</li><li>Incidents on or damage to the tarmac</li><li>Technical glitches affecting check-in or security</li><li>Air traffic control or radar problems</li></ul>When things like this happen, it often results in air traffic congestion or even airport closure until the incident is resolved. While airlines may not be held liable for flight disruptions due to these situations, it does depend on the circumstances in each instance."
    problems_on_board_of_the_aircraft: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was due to problems on board the aircraft. These may include:<ul><li>Equipment or instrumentation malfunctions</li><li>Safety concerns such as fire or smoke</li></ul>There may be situations in which the airline is not legally liable for resulting flight disruptions, but further investigation is needed to determine what amount of responsibility the airline should bear in this case. At this point we see no reason why the airline should not be held accountable."
    rerouting_within_acceptable_time_frame: "The airline claims that you arrived at your final destination within a legally acceptable timeframe. Under EU law, if you accept re-routing on an alternative flight and arrive at your destination within a given timeframe, depending on your flight details, it can affect your eligibility and the compensation amount you are owed."
    security_reasons: "The airline has stated that the flight disruption was due to security issues, which may include the following:<ul><li>Evacuation of flights while at the terminal</li><li>Reports or threats of violence at the airport</li><li>Terrorist attacks or coup attempts</li><li>Unruly or suspicious passengers.</li><li>Protesters or unauthorized people in secure areas</li></ul>While airlines might not be held liable for flight disruptions due to these situations, it does depend on the circumstances in each instance."
    strike: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was caused by a labor strike. The flight crew and airline employees play a key role in guaranteeing flight operations, whereas airport staff related to security, baggage handling, air traffic control, and other departments are critical in maintaining safe and efficient operations at an airport. Labor disruptions with any of these groups can significantly impact or even completely halt air traffic. These situations often cannot be predicted or controlled by the airline, so it is not always possible to hold them legally accountable for resulting flight disruptions, although it does depend on the particular circumstances involved."
    technical_problems: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was due to an unforeseen technical problem with the aircraft. While there are some instances in which airlines cannot be held accountable, such as parts manufacturer defects, there are many other situations where the airline may, indeed, be required to pay compensation. Further investigation is needed to determine the circumstances in your case."
    unexpected_flight_safety_concerns: "The airline has stated that your flight disruption was due to security issues, which may include the following:<ul><li>Evacuation of flights while at the terminal</li><li>Reports or threats of violence at the airport</li><li>Terrorist attacks or coup attempts</li><li>Unruly or suspicious passengers</li><li>Protesters or unauthorized people in secure areas</li></ul>While airlines might not be held liable for flight disruptions due to these situations, it does depend on the circumstances in each instance."
    weather_conditions: "The airline has stated that the flight disruption was caused by severe weather conditions. These may include:<ul><li>Icy conditions</li><li>Thunderstorms and heavy precipitation</li><li>Strong winds, turbulence, or up/downdrafts</li><li>Poor visibility</li><li>Volcanic activity</li></ul>Safety is of the utmost importance in air travel, so poor weather conditions can reduce or even completely halt air traffic. While airlines may not be held liable for flight disruptions due to severe weather, further investigation is needed to confirm the circumstances in your case"
