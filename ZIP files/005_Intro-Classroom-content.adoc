== Creating a Lab Environment

The Red{nbsp}Hat Online Learning (ROL) platform provides a RHEL{nbsp}8 workstation environment in the cloud, which you can connect to remotely from your browser.
To use this, click the btn:[CREATE] button in the btn:[Lab Environment] tab in the ROL interface.

For all classrooms provisioned for this course, ROL also provisions an account for you on a shared Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) 4 cluster.
When you provision your environment in the ROL interface, the system provides the cluster information.
The interface gives you the OpenShift web console URL, your user name, and your password.

The required tools are preinstalled in the `+Cloud Workstation+` classroom environment, which also includes VSCodium, a text editor that includes useful development features.

== Cloud Workstation Classroom Overview

In this environment, the main computer system used for hands-on learning activities is `+workstation+`.
All virtual machines in the classroom environment are in the `+lab.example.com+` DNS domain.

All student computer systems have a standard user account, `+student+`, which has the password `+student+`.
The root password on all student systems is `+redhat+`.

.Classroom Machines

|===
| Machine name                | IP addresses   | Role
| workstation.lab.example.com | 172.25.250.9   | Graphical workstation used by students
| bastion.lab.example.com     | 172.25.250.254 | Router linking student's VMs to classroom servers
| classroom.lab.example.com   | 172.25.252.254 | Server hosting the classroom materials required by the course

The `+bastion+` system acts as a router between the network that connects the student machines and the classroom network.
If `+bastion+` is down, then other student machines may not function properly or may even hang during boot.

== Lab Directory Structure Considerations

The AD221 course uses a Python-based `+lab+` script that configures the directory structure for each guided exercise and lab activity.
The ((workspace)) directory for this course is `+/home/student/AD221+`.

The workspace directory must contain the `+AD221-apps+` repository.
This is the code repository that contains the necessary files for each activity in this course.
The first guided exercise of the course guides you to clone this repository in `+/home/student/AD221/AD221-apps+`.
The `+lab+` script uses the locally cloned `+AD221-apps+` repository to create a directory structure relevant to a particular guided exercise or lab activity.

For example, the `+lab start route-messages+` command does the following:

* Pulls the most recent code from the `+AD221-apps+` remote repository.
* Creates a `+route-messages+` directory in the workspace: `+/home/student/AD221/route-messages+`.
* Copies the `+/home/student/AD221/AD221-apps/route-messages/apps/+` source code subdirectories to the `+/home/student/AD221/route-messages+` directory.

You can find the solution for each activity in the `+/home/student/AD221/AD221-apps+` repository.
For example, for the `+route-messages+` guided exercise, see the `+/home/student/AD221/AD221-apps/route-messages/solutions+` directory.

== Troubleshooting Lab Scripts

If an error occurs while running the `+lab+` command, then you might want to check the following files:

* `+/tmp/log/labs+`: This directory contains log files.
The `+lab+` script creates a unique log file for each activity.
For example, the log file for the `+lab start intro-setup+` command is `+/tmp/log/labs/intro_setup+`
* `+/home/student/.grading/config.yaml+`: This file contains the course-specific configuration.
Do not modify this file.
* `+/home/student/.grading/ad221-workspace.json+`: This file contains the user-specific lab configuration.
The `+ocp_*+` properties must match the values provided in ROL.
Do not manually modify this file.
The file is created by the `+lab start intro-setup+` script.
