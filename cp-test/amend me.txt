Add new lines to this file repeatedly and watch how long it takes for a TMS continuous job (triggered by a webhook) to sync.

Good luck!
whoo, I'm feeling lucky then!
What about adding another line?
hmm, and a third one in the row?_ it still works!
Adding one more, after several days.
This one after 12 minutes...
And after 40 seconds.
And after 30 seconds.
Line 10 did not update though.
Let's add line 12
And line 13
What about line 14?
Now comes the tricky part, liens 14 and 13 may disappear from the job!
And now, whatever I do, the job won't refresh for several minutes at least. (the caching)
Now everything will be added
ok, cool!
