= Sample Title

In this exercise you will configure the lab environment required for the course exercises.

== Outcomes

You should be able to configure the classroom environment and clone the sample code.

== Prerequisites

To perform this exercise, ensure you have access to the Red{nbsp}Hat Online Learning Environment (ROL).

[role='Checklist']
== Instructions

The following procedure describes how to provision and configure a new classroom from the RedÂ Hat Online Learning platform.
You must complete the following procedure before attempting any of the course activities.

1) Provision a new lab environment.

Click the btn:[Lab Environment] tab on the ROL course page.
Next, click btn:[CREATE] to start provisioning the lab environment

2) Open the workstation console.

After the lab environment is ready, click btn:[OPEN CONSOLE] in the `+workstation+` virtual machine, and log in as the `+student+` user with the password `+student+`.

3) Configure the workspace.

3.1) Open a new terminal window, and use the `+lab+` command to initialize the workspace and user-specific configuration.

[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation ~]$ *lab start intro-setup*

This script configures the lab environment, and the connection parameters to access the OpenShift cluster.

Enter your workspace directory: [/home/student/AD221]:
_...output omitted..._
----

When running the `+lab+` command, enter the OpenShift details provided in the btn:[Lab Environment] tab.
Do not change the workspace directory.

3.1) Navigate to the `+~/AD221+` directory.

4) Clone the `+AD221-apps+` repository to your `+AD221+` workspace.

4.1) From the `+AD221+` workspace directory, clone the `+AD221-apps+` repository to your workstation:

[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation AD221]$ *git clone https://github.com/RedHatTraining/AD221-apps.git*
Cloning into 'AD221-apps'...
_...output omitted..._
----

4.1) Verify that the cloned repository contains the repository content and return to the workspace directory.

[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation AD221]$ *cd AD221-apps*
[student@workstation AD221-apps]$ *head README.md*
# AD221 Application Repository
_...output omitted..._
[student@workstation AD221-apps]$ *cd ..*
----

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Install the Camel K command line interface (CLI).

5.1) Download the CLI application through the OpenShift web console.

Find the btn:[Lab Environment] tab on your ROL course page.
This table should be visible after you provision your online lab environment.

The btn:[Console Web Application] link in the `+OpenShift Details+` table opens the web console for your dedicated Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform instance.
Take note of your `+Username+` and `+Password+`, which you will be using in the next step.

5.1) From the `+workstation+` virtual machine, open a web browser and log in to the OpenShift web console using your `+Username+` and `+Password+`.

5.1) After logging in, click btn:[?] in the upper-right corner, and then click btn:[Command Line Tools].

5.1) On the `+Command Line Tools+` page, download the Camel K CLI compressed binary file for Linux from the list btn:[kamel - Red{nbsp}Hat Integration - Camel K - Command Line Interface]

5.1) Unpack the compressed archive file, and then copy the `+kamel+` binary to `+/usr/local/bin+`.

[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation ~]$ *sudo cp kamel /usr/local/bin/*
[student@workstation ~]$ *sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kamel*
----

5.1) Verify that the `+kamel+` binary works.
Open a new command line terminal and run the following:

[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation ~]$ *kamel version*
Camel K Client Red Hat 1.6.0
----

[NOTE]
====
Your output might be slightly different based on the version of the Camel K client that you downloaded.
