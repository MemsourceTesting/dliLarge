  <section><title>Admonitions</title>
    <para>
      Red&nbsp;Hat Training courses use the following admonitions:
    </para>
  <note role="References">
    <para>
      These describe where to find external documentation relevant to a subject.
    </para>
  </note>
  <note>
    <para>
      These are tips, shortcuts, or alternative approaches to the task at hand.
      Ignoring a note should have no negative consequences, but you might miss out on something that makes your life easier.
    </para>
  </note>
  <important>
    <para>
      These provide details of information that is easily missed: configuration changes that only apply to the current session, or services that need restarting before an update will apply.
      Ignoring these admonitions will not cause data loss, but may cause irritation and frustration.
    </para>
  </important>
  <warning>
